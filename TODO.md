# Create behavioral clustering based on features, as projecting new samples on DTW clustered data is not possible (To dispaly together,e verything has to be recalculated)

# Add correction for drift in the images, some test images seems to ahve some flow due to imaging, not cells, leading to incorrect features

# Add a docker object to ease the installation of BEHAV3D

# Allow customization of the feature calculation
